** TODO  Think about using the package Data.IntSet.Translatable      <2016-01-13 Wed 15:26>
This is because the append function between HyperRelation requires translation
in the indexes. But how that packages compares wrt other operations, like
intersection?

** TODO  Change the Show instance of HyperRelation      <2016-01-13 Wed 15:40>
This should be done after the development becomes stable. This in analogy to
what the other data structure packages do (containers etc.): they just represent
a structure with "fromList STUFF", where STUFF contains only the useful
informations.
